    "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil": "\n Brazil,[b] officially the Federative Republic of Brazil,[c] is the largest and easternmost country in South America. It is the world's fifth-largest country by area and the seventh largest by population, with over 212 million people. The country is a federation composed of 26 states and a Federal District, which hosts the capital, Bras\u00edlia. Its most populous city is S\u00e3o Paulo, followed by Rio de Janeiro. Brazil has the most Portuguese speakers in the world and is the only country in the Americas where Portuguese is an official language. [11][12]\n Bounded by the Atlantic Ocean on the east, Brazil has a coastline of 7,491 kilometers (4,655\u00a0mi). [13] Covering roughly half of South America's land area, it borders all other countries and territories on the continent except Ecuador and Chile. [14] Brazil encompasses a wide range of tropical and subtropical landscapes, as well as wetlands, savannas, plateaus, and low mountains. It contains most of the Amazon basin, including the world\u2019s largest river system and most extensive virgin tropical forest. Brazil has a diverse wildlife, a variety of ecological systems, and extensive natural resources spanning numerous protected habitats. [13] The country ranks first among 17 megadiverse countries, with its natural heritage being the subject of significant global interest, as environmental degradation (through processes such as deforestation) directly affect global issues such as climate change and biodiversity loss. Brazil was inhabited by various indigenous peoples prior to the landing of Portuguese explorer Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral in 1500. It was claimed and settled by Portugal, which forcibly imported enslaved Africans to work on plantations. Brazil remained a colony until 1815, when it was elevated to the rank of kingdom upon the formation of the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves after the transfer of the Portuguese court to Rio de Janeiro. Prince Pedro of Braganza declared the country's independence in 1822, establishing the Empire of Brazil, a unitary state governed under a parliamentary constitutional monarchy. Brazil's first constitution in 1824 established a bicameral legislature, now called the National Congress, and enshrined principles such as freedom of religion and the press, but retained slavery, which was gradually abolished throughout the 19th century until its final abolition in 1888. Brazil became a presidential republic following a military coup d'\u00e9tat in 1889. An authoritarian military dictatorship emerged in 1964 and ruled until 1985, after which civilian governance resumed. Brazil's current constitution, enacted in 1988, defines it as a democratic federal republic. [15]\n Brazil is a regional and middle power[16][17][18] and rising global power. [19][20][21][22] It is an emerging,[23][24] upper-middle income economy and newly industrialized country,[25] with one of the 10 largest economies in the world in both nominal and PPP terms,[7][26] the largest economy in Latin America and the Southern Hemisphere, and the largest share of wealth in South America. With a complex and highly diversified economy, Brazil is one of the world's major or primary exporters of various agricultural goods, mineral resources, and manufactured products. [27] Due to its rich culture and history, the country ranks thirteenth in the world by number of UNESCO World Heritage Sites. [28] Brazil is a founding member of the United Nations, the G20, BRICS, G4, Mercosur, Organization of American States, Organization of Ibero-American States, and the Community of Portuguese Language Countries; it is also an observer state of the Arab League and a major non-NATO ally of the United States. [29][30]\n The word Brazil probably comes from the Portuguese word for brazilwood, a tree that once grew plentifully along the Brazilian coast. [31] In Portuguese, brazilwood is called pau-brasil, with the word brasil commonly given the etymology \"red like an ember\", formed from brasa ('ember') and the suffix -il (from -iculum or -ilium). [32] It has alternatively been suggested that this is a folk etymology for a word for the plant related to an Arabic or Asian word for a red plant. [33] As brazilwood produces a deep red dye, it was highly valued by the European textile industry and was the earliest commercially exploited product from Brazil. [34] Throughout the 16th century, massive amounts of brazilwood were harvested by indigenous peoples (mostly Tupi) along the Brazilian coast, who sold the timber to European traders (mostly Portuguese, but also French) in return for assorted European consumer goods. [35]\n The official Portuguese name of the land, in original Portuguese records, was the \"Land of the Holy Cross\" (Terra da Santa Cruz),[36] but European sailors and merchants commonly called it the \"Land of Brazil\" (Terra do Brasil) because of the brazilwood trade. [37] The popular appellation eclipsed and eventually supplanted the official Portuguese name. Some early sailors called it the \"Land of Parrots\". [38]\n In the Guaran\u00ed language, an official language of Paraguay, Brazil is called \"Pindorama\", meaning 'land of the palm trees'. [39]\n Some of the earliest human remains found in the Americas, Luzia Woman, were found in the area of Pedro Leopoldo, Minas Gerais and provide evidence of human habitation going back at least 11,000 years. [41][42]\nThe earliest pottery ever found in the Western Hemisphere was excavated in the Amazon basin of Brazil and radiocarbon dated to over 8,000 years ago (6000 BC). The pottery was found near Santar\u00e9m and provides evidence that the region supported a complex prehistoric culture. [43] The Marajoara culture flourished on Maraj\u00f3 in the Amazon delta from AD 400 to 1400, developing sophisticated pottery, social stratification, large populations, mound building, and complex social formations such as chiefdoms. [44]\n Around the time of the Portuguese arrival, the territory of current day Brazil had an estimated indigenous population of 7 million people,[45] mostly semi-nomadic, who subsisted on hunting, fishing, gathering, and migrant agriculture. The population comprised several large indigenous ethnic groups (e.g., the Tupis, Guaranis, G\u00eas, and Arawaks). The Tupi people were subdivided into the Tupiniquins and Tupinamb\u00e1s. [46]\n Before the arrival of the Europeans, the boundaries between these groups and their subgroups were marked by wars that arose from differences in culture, language and moral beliefs. [47] These wars also involved large-scale military actions on land and water, with cannibalistic rituals on prisoners of war. [48][49] While heredity had some weight, leadership was a status more won over time than assigned in succession ceremonies and conventions. [47] Slavery among the indigenous groups had a different meaning than it had for Europeans, since it originated from a diverse socioeconomic organization, in which asymmetries were translated into kinship relations. [50]\n Following the 1494 Treaty of Tordesillas, the land now called Brazil was claimed for the Portuguese Empire on 22 April 1500, with the arrival of the Portuguese fleet commanded by Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral. [52] The Portuguese encountered indigenous peoples divided into several ethnic societies, most of whom spoke languages of the Tupi\u2013Guarani family and fought among themselves. [53] Though the first settlement was founded in 1532, colonization effectively began in 1534, when King John\u00a0III of Portugal divided the territory into the fifteen private and autonomous captaincies. [54][55]\n However, the decentralized and unorganized tendencies of the captaincies proved problematic, and in 1549 the Portuguese king restructured them into the Governorate General of Brazil in the city of Salvador, which became the capital of a single and centralized Portuguese colony in South America. [55][56] In the first two centuries of colonization, Indigenous and European groups lived in constant war, establishing opportunistic alliances in order to gain advantages against each other. [57][58][59][60]\n By the mid-16th century, cane sugar had become Brazil's most important export,[53][61] while slaves purchased in Sub-Saharan Africa in the slave market of Western Africa[62] (not only those from Portuguese allies of their colonies in Angola and Mozambique), had become its largest import,[63][64] to cope with sugarcane plantations, due to increasing international demand for Brazilian sugar. [65][66] Brazil received more than 2.8 million slaves from Africa between the years 1500 and 1800. [67]\n By the end of the 17th century, sugarcane exports began to decline[68] and the discovery of gold by bandeirantes in the 1690s would become the new backbone of the colony's economy, fostering a gold rush[69] which attracted thousands of new settlers to Brazil from Portugal and all Portuguese colonies around the world. [70] This increased level of immigration in turn caused some conflicts between newcomers and old settlers. [71]\n Portuguese expeditions known as bandeiras gradually expanded Brazil's original colonial frontiers in South America to its approximately current borders. [72][73] In this era, other European powers tried to colonize parts of Brazil, in incursions that the Portuguese had to fight, notably the French in Rio during the 1560s, in Maranh\u00e3o during the 1610s, and the Dutch in Bahia and Pernambuco, during the Dutch\u2013Portuguese War, after the end of Iberian Union. [74]\n The Portuguese colonial administration in Brazil had two objectives that would ensure colonial order and the monopoly of Portugal's wealthiest and largest colony: to keep under control and eradicate all forms of slave rebellion and resistance, such as the Quilombo of Palmares,[75] and to repress all movements for autonomy or independence, such as the Minas Gerais Conspiracy. [76]\n In late 1807, Spanish and Napoleonic forces threatened the security of continental Portugal, causing Prince Regent John, in the name of Queen Maria I, to move the royal court from Lisbon to Rio de Janeiro. [77] There they established some of Brazil's first financial institutions, such as its local stock exchanges[78] and its National Bank, additionally ending the Portuguese monopoly on Brazilian trade and opening Brazil's ports to other nations. In 1809, in retaliation for being forced into exile, the Prince Regent ordered the conquest of French Guiana. [79]\n With the end of the Peninsular War in 1814, the courts of Europe demanded that Queen Maria I and Prince Regent John return to Portugal, deeming it unfit for the head of an ancient European monarchy to reside in a colony. In 1815, to justify continuing to live in Brazil, where the royal court had thrived for six years, the Crown established the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves, thus creating a pluricontinental transatlantic monarchic state. [80] However, the leadership in Portugal, resentful of the new status of its larger colony, continued to demand the return of the court to Lisbon (see Liberal Revolution of 1820). In 1821, acceding to the demands of revolutionaries who had taken the city of Porto,[81] John VI departed for Lisbon. There he swore an oath to the new constitution, leaving his son, Prince Pedro de Alc\u00e2ntara, as Regent of the Kingdom of Brazil. [82]\n Tensions between Portuguese and Brazilians increased and the Portuguese Cortes, guided by the new political regime imposed by the Liberal Revolution, tried to re-establish Brazil as a colony. [83] The Brazilians refused to yield, and Prince Pedro decided to stand with them, declaring the country's independence from Portugal on 7 September 1822. [84] A month later, Prince Pedro was declared the first Emperor of Brazil, with the royal title of Dom Pedro\u00a0I, resulting in the founding of the Empire of Brazil. [85]\n The Brazilian War of Independence, which had already begun along this process, spread through the northern, northeastern regions and in the Cisplatina province. [86] The last Portuguese soldiers surrendered on 8 March 1824;[87] Portugal officially recognized Brazilian independence on 29 August 1825. [88]\n On 7 April 1831, worn down by years of administrative turmoil and political dissent with both liberal and conservative sides of politics, including an attempt of republican secession[89] and unreconciled to the way that absolutists in Portugal had given in the succession of King John VI, Pedro\u00a0I departed for Portugal to reclaim his daughter's crown after abdicating the Brazilian throne in favor of his five-year-old son and heir (Dom Pedro\u00a0II). [90]\n As the new Emperor could not exert his constitutional powers until he came of age, a regency was set up by the National Assembly. [91] In the absence of a charismatic figure who could represent a moderate face of power, during this period a series of localized rebellions took place, such as the Cabanagem in Gr\u00e3o-Par\u00e1, the Mal\u00ea Revolt in Salvador, the Balaiada (Maranh\u00e3o), the Sabinada (Bahia), and the Ragamuffin War, which began in Rio Grande do Sul and was supported by Giuseppe Garibaldi. These emerged from the provinces' dissatisfaction with the central power, coupled with old and latent social tensions peculiar to a vast, slaveholding and newly independent nation state. [92] This period of internal political and social upheaval, which included the Praieira revolt in Pernambuco, was overcome only at the end of the 1840s, years after the end of the regency, which occurred with the premature coronation of Pedro II in 1841. [93]\n During the last phase of the monarchy, internal political debate centered on the issue of slavery. The Atlantic slave trade was abandoned in 1850,[94] as a result of the British Aberdeen Act and the Eus\u00e9bio de Queir\u00f3s Law, but only in May 1888, after a long process of internal mobilization and debate for an ethical and legal dismantling of slavery in the country, was the institution formally abolished with the approval of the Golden Law. [95]\n The foreign-affairs policies of the monarchy dealt with issues with the countries of the Southern Cone with whom Brazil had borders. Long after the Cisplatine War that resulted in the independence of Uruguay,[96] Brazil won three international wars during the 58-year reign of Pedro\u00a0II: the Platine War, the Uruguayan War and the devastating Paraguayan War, the largest war effort in Brazilian history. [97][98]\n Although there was no desire among the majority of Brazilians to change the country's form of government,[99] on 15 November 1889, in disagreement with the majority of the Imperial Army officers, as well as with rural and financial elites (for different reasons), the monarchy was overthrown by a military coup. [100] A few days later, the national flag was replaced with a new design that included the national motto \"Ordem e Progresso\", influenced by positivism. 15 November is now Republic Day, a national holiday. [101]\n The early republican government was a military dictatorship, with the army dominating affairs both in Rio de Janeiro and in the states. Freedom of the press disappeared and elections were controlled by those in power. [102] Not until 1894, following an economic crisis and a military one, did civilians take power, remaining there until October 1930. [103][104][105]\n In relation to its foreign policy, the country in this first republican period maintained a relative balance characterized by a success in resolving border disputes with neighboring countries,[106] only broken by the Acre War (1899\u20131902) and its involvement in World War I (1914\u20131918),[107][108][109] followed by a failed attempt to exert a prominent role in the League of Nations;[110] Internally, from the crisis of Encilhamento[111][112][113] and the Navy Revolts,[114] a prolonged cycle of financial, political and social instability began until the 1920s, keeping the country besieged by various rebellions, both civilian[115][116][117] and military. [118][119][120]\n Little by little, a cycle of general instability sparked by these crises undermined the regime to such an extent that in the wake of the murder of his running mate, the defeated opposition presidential candidate Get\u00falio Vargas, supported by most of the military, successfully led the Revolution of 1930. [121][122] Vargas and the military were supposed to assume power temporarily, but instead closed down Congress, extinguished the Constitution, ruled with emergency powers and replaced the states' governors with his own supporters. [123][124]\n In the 1930s, three attempts to remove Vargas and his supporters from power failed. The first was the Constitutionalist Revolution in 1932, led by S\u00e3o Paulo's oligarchy. The second was a Communist uprising in November 1935, and the last one a putsch attempt by local fascists in May 1938. [125][126][127] The 1935 uprising created a security crisis in which Congress transferred more power to the executive branch. The 1937 coup d'\u00e9tat resulted in the cancellation of the 1938 election and formalized Vargas as dictator, beginning the Estado Novo era. During this period, government brutality and censorship of the press increased. [128]\n During World War II, Brazil remained neutral until August 1942, when the country suffered retaliation by Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy in a strategic dispute over the South Atlantic, and, therefore, entered the war on the allied side. [129][130][131] In addition to its participation in the battle of the Atlantic, Brazil also sent an expeditionary force to fight in the Italian campaign. [132]\n With the Allied victory in 1945 and the end of the fascist regimes in Europe, Vargas's position became unsustainable, and he was swiftly overthrown in another military coup, with democracy \"reinstated\" by the same army that had ended it 15 years earlier. [133] Vargas committed suicide in August 1954 amid a political crisis, after having returned to power by election in 1950. [134][135]\n Several brief interim governments followed Vargas's suicide. [136] Juscelino Kubitschek became president in 1956 and assumed a conciliatory posture towards the political opposition that allowed him to govern without major crises. [137] The economy and industrial sector grew remarkably,[138] but his greatest achievement was the construction of the new capital city of Bras\u00edlia, inaugurated in 1960.",

    "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence": "\n Artificial intelligence (AI), in its broadest sense, is intelligence exhibited by machines, particularly computer systems. It is a field of research in computer science that develops and studies methods and software that enable machines to perceive their environment and use learning and intelligence to take actions that maximize their chances of achieving defined goals. [1] Such machines may be called AIs. High-profile applications of AI include advanced web search engines (e.g., Google Search); recommendation systems (used by YouTube, Amazon, and Netflix); virtual assistants (e.g., Google Assistant, Siri, and Alexa); autonomous vehicles (e.g., Waymo); generative and creative tools (e.g., ChatGPT and AI art); and superhuman play and analysis in strategy games (e.g., chess and Go). However, many AI applications are not perceived as AI: \"A lot of cutting edge AI has filtered into general applications, often without being called AI because once something becomes useful enough and common enough it's not labeled AI anymore. \"[2][3]\n Various subfields of AI research are centered around particular goals and the use of particular tools. The traditional goals of AI research include reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, learning, natural language processing, perception, and support for robotics. [a] General intelligence\u2014the ability to complete any task performed by a human on an at least equal level\u2014is among the field's long-term goals. [4] To reach these goals, AI researchers have adapted and integrated a wide range of techniques, including search and mathematical optimization, formal logic, artificial neural networks, and methods based on statistics, operations research, and economics. [b] AI also draws upon psychology, linguistics, philosophy, neuroscience, and other fields. [5]\n Artificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1956,[6] and the field went through multiple cycles of optimism throughout its history,[7][8] followed by periods of disappointment and loss of funding, known as AI winters. [9][10] Funding and interest vastly increased after 2012 when deep learning outperformed previous AI techniques. [11] This growth accelerated further after 2017 with the transformer architecture,[12] and by the early 2020s many billions of dollars were being invested in AI and the field experienced rapid ongoing progress in what has become known as the AI boom. The emergence of advanced generative AI in the midst of the AI boom and its ability to create and modify content exposed several unintended consequences and harms in the present and raised concerns about the risks of AI and its long-term effects in the future, prompting discussions about regulatory policies to ensure the safety and benefits of the technology. The general problem of simulating (or creating) intelligence has been broken into subproblems. These consist of particular traits or capabilities that researchers expect an intelligent system to display. The traits described below have received the most attention and cover the scope of AI research. [a]\n Early researchers developed algorithms that imitated step-by-step reasoning that humans use when they solve puzzles or make logical deductions. [13] By the late 1980s and 1990s, methods were developed for dealing with uncertain or incomplete information, employing concepts from probability and economics. [14]\n Many of these algorithms are insufficient for solving large reasoning problems because they experience a \"combinatorial explosion\": They become exponentially slower as the problems grow. [15] Even humans rarely use the step-by-step deduction that early AI research could model. They solve most of their problems using fast, intuitive judgments. [16] Accurate and efficient reasoning is an unsolved problem. Knowledge representation and knowledge engineering[17] allow AI programs to answer questions intelligently and make deductions about real-world facts. Formal knowledge representations are used in content-based indexing and retrieval,[18] scene interpretation,[19] clinical decision support,[20] knowledge discovery (mining \"interesting\" and actionable inferences from large databases),[21] and other areas. [22]\n A knowledge base is a body of knowledge represented in a form that can be used by a program. An ontology is the set of objects, relations, concepts, and properties used by a particular domain of knowledge. [23] Knowledge bases need to represent things such as objects, properties, categories, and relations between objects;[24] situations, events, states, and time;[25] causes and effects;[26] knowledge about knowledge (what we know about what other people know);[27] default reasoning (things that humans assume are true until they are told differently and will remain true even when other facts are changing);[28] and many other aspects and domains of knowledge. Among the most difficult problems in knowledge representation are the breadth of commonsense knowledge (the set of atomic facts that the average person knows is enormous);[29] and the sub-symbolic form of most commonsense knowledge (much of what people know is not represented as \"facts\" or \"statements\" that they could express verbally). [16] There is also the difficulty of knowledge acquisition, the problem of obtaining knowledge for AI applications. [c]\n An \"agent\" is anything that perceives and takes actions in the world. A rational agent has goals or preferences and takes actions to make them happen. [d][32] In automated planning, the agent has a specific goal. [33] In automated decision-making, the agent has preferences\u2014there are some situations it would prefer to be in, and some situations it is trying to avoid. The decision-making agent assigns a number to each situation (called the \"utility\") that measures how much the agent prefers it. For each possible action, it can calculate the \"expected utility\": the utility of all possible outcomes of the action, weighted by the probability that the outcome will occur. It can then choose the action with the maximum expected utility. [34]\n In classical planning, the agent knows exactly what the effect of any action will be. [35] In most real-world problems, however, the agent may not be certain about the situation they are in (it is \"unknown\" or \"unobservable\") and it may not know for certain what will happen after each possible action (it is not \"deterministic\"). It must choose an action by making a probabilistic guess and then reassess the situation to see if the action worked. [36]\n In some problems, the agent's preferences may be uncertain, especially if there are other agents or humans involved. These can be learned (e.g., with inverse reinforcement learning), or the agent can seek information to improve its preferences. [37] Information value theory can be used to weigh the value of exploratory or experimental actions. [38] The space of possible future actions and situations is typically intractably large, so the agents must take actions and evaluate situations while being uncertain of what the outcome will be. A Markov decision process has a transition model that describes the probability that a particular action will change the state in a particular way and a reward function that supplies the utility of each state and the cost of each action. A policy associates a decision with each possible state. The policy could be calculated (e.g., by iteration), be heuristic, or it can be learned. [39]\n Game theory describes the rational behavior of multiple interacting agents and is used in AI programs that make decisions that involve other agents. [40]\n Machine learning is the study of programs that can improve their performance on a given task automatically. [41] It has been a part of AI from the beginning. [e]\n There are several kinds of machine learning. Unsupervised learning analyzes a stream of data and finds patterns and makes predictions without any other guidance. [44] Supervised learning requires labeling the training data with the expected answers, and comes in two main varieties: classification (where the program must learn to predict what category the input belongs in) and regression (where the program must deduce a numeric function based on numeric input). [45]\n In reinforcement learning, the agent is rewarded for good responses and punished for bad ones. The agent learns to choose responses that are classified as \"good\". [46] Transfer learning is when the knowledge gained from one problem is applied to a new problem. [47] Deep learning is a type of machine learning that runs inputs through biologically inspired artificial neural networks for all of these types of learning. [48]\n Computational learning theory can assess learners by computational complexity, by sample complexity (how much data is required), or by other notions of optimization. [49]\n Natural language processing (NLP)[50] allows programs to read, write and communicate in human languages such as English. Specific problems include speech recognition, speech synthesis, machine translation, information extraction, information retrieval and question answering. [51]\n Early work, based on Noam Chomsky's generative grammar and semantic networks, had difficulty with word-sense disambiguation[f] unless restricted to small domains called \"micro-worlds\" (due to the common sense knowledge problem[29]). Margaret Masterman believed that it was meaning and not grammar that was the key to understanding languages, and that thesauri and not dictionaries should be the basis of computational language structure. Modern deep learning techniques for NLP include word embedding (representing words, typically as vectors encoding their meaning),[52] transformers (a deep learning architecture using an attention mechanism),[53] and others. [54] In 2019, generative pre-trained transformer (or \"GPT\") language models began to generate coherent text,[55][56] and by 2023, these models were able to get human-level scores on the bar exam, SAT test, GRE test, and many other real-world applications. [57]\n Machine perception is the ability to use input from sensors (such as cameras, microphones, wireless signals, active lidar, sonar, radar, and tactile sensors) to deduce aspects of the world. Computer vision is the ability to analyze visual input. [58]\n The field includes speech recognition,[59] image classification,[60] facial recognition, object recognition,[61]object tracking,[62] and robotic perception. [63]\n Affective computing is a field that comprises systems that recognize, interpret, process, or simulate human feeling, emotion, and mood. [65] For example, some virtual assistants are programmed to speak conversationally or even to banter humorously; it makes them appear more sensitive to the emotional dynamics of human interaction, or to otherwise facilitate human\u2013computer interaction. However, this tends to give na\u00efve users an unrealistic conception of the intelligence of existing computer agents. [66] Moderate successes related to affective computing include textual sentiment analysis and, more recently, multimodal sentiment analysis, wherein AI classifies the effects displayed by a videotaped subject. [67]\n A machine with artificial general intelligence should be able to solve a wide variety of problems with breadth and versatility similar to human intelligence. [4]\n AI research uses a wide variety of techniques to accomplish the goals above. [b]\n AI can solve many problems by intelligently searching through many possible solutions. [68] There are two very different kinds of search used in AI: state space search and local search. State space search searches through a tree of possible states to try to find a goal state. [69] For example, planning algorithms search through trees of goals and subgoals, attempting to find a path to a target goal, a process called means-ends analysis. [70]\n Simple exhaustive searches[71] are rarely sufficient for most real-world problems: the search space (the number of places to search) quickly grows to astronomical numbers. The result is a search that is too slow or never completes. [15] \"Heuristics\" or \"rules of thumb\" can help prioritize choices that are more likely to reach a goal. [72]\n Adversarial search is used for game-playing programs, such as chess or Go. It searches through a tree of possible moves and countermoves, looking for a winning position. [73]\n Local search uses mathematical optimization to find a solution to a problem. It begins with some form of guess and refines it incrementally. [74]\n Gradient descent is a type of local search that optimizes a set of numerical parameters by incrementally adjusting them to minimize a loss function. Variants of gradient descent are commonly used to train neural networks,[75] through the backpropagation algorithm. Another type of local search is evolutionary computation, which aims to iteratively improve a set of candidate solutions by \"mutating\" and \"recombining\" them, selecting only the fittest to survive each generation. [76]\n Distributed search processes can coordinate via swarm intelligence algorithms. Two popular swarm algorithms used in search are particle swarm optimization (inspired by bird flocking) and ant colony optimization (inspired by ant trails). [77]\n Formal logic is used for reasoning and knowledge representation. [78]\nFormal logic comes in two main forms: propositional logic (which operates on statements that are true or false and uses logical connectives such as \"and\", \"or\", \"not\" and \"implies\")[79] and predicate logic (which also operates on objects, predicates and relations and uses quantifiers such as \"Every X is a Y\" and \"There are some Xs that are Ys\"). [80]\n Deductive reasoning in logic is the process of proving a new statement (conclusion) from other statements that are given and assumed to be true (the premises). [81] Proofs can be structured as proof trees, in which nodes are labelled by sentences, and children nodes are connected to parent nodes by inference rules. Given a problem and a set of premises, problem-solving reduces to searching for a proof tree whose root node is labelled by a solution of the problem and whose leaf nodes are labelled by premises or axioms. In the case of Horn clauses, problem-solving search can be performed by reasoning forwards from the premises or backwards from the problem. [82] In the more general case of the clausal form of first-order logic, resolution is a single, axiom-free rule of inference, in which a problem is solved by proving a contradiction from premises that include the negation of the problem to be solved. [83]\n Inference in both Horn clause logic and first-order logic is undecidable, and therefore intractable. However, backward reasoning with Horn clauses, which underpins computation in the logic programming language Prolog, is Turing complete. Moreover, its efficiency is competitive with computation in other symbolic programming languages. [84]\n Fuzzy logic assigns a \"degree of truth\" between 0 and 1."
